            <p>
            I am a Full Stack Web Developer with a Bachelors in Business and Psychology. I am currently earning a Certificate in Full Stack Web Development from Carleton University where I have developed skills in JavaScript, Node.js, Express.js, SQL, CSS, and HTML.
            I have a strong passion for problem-solving and developing creative solutions. I worked on Cruise Ships with Park West Gallery for many years which allowed me to develop strong skills working in fast paced environments and with diverse teams.
            I am able to utilize my vast experience to tackle any project handed to me with eagerness and determination.
